Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

Setting up qemu to work on the deku project

Build the kernel with required drivers (e1000 for networking) and install qemu.
Create 2 disks. Rootfs using debootimage where you can create a minimal
rootfs using debian. And an empty 30G qcow2 image using qemu-img.

Boot the qemu using the run-qemu script. 
To get networking working, update the /etc/network/interfaces file 
with the eth0/ens3 entry (check using ip link show), use chatgpt/google
to decide what to write in the file.

Inside the guest, mount the 30G disk to /mnt/disk and update fstab to
make sure the disk is always mounted when qemu reboots.
